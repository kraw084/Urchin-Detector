- The complete data set is compiled from the UOA, Tasmania and NSW urchin data sets on squidle
- It only contains the images from those datasets that have urchin bounding boxes/polygons or are empty

Headers
- id: used to index the images
- url: url of the image, can be used to download it
- name: name of the image, not these may not be unique across deployment
- source: the name of the data set the image was sourced from
- deployment: deployment the image was taken from
- campaign: campaign the image was take from
- latitude: latitude the image was taken at
- longitude: longitude the image was take at
- depth: depth the image was taken at
- time: the time the photo was taken 
- flagged: True or false, whether the image contains a box that is flagged for review (may not contain an urchin)
- boxes: a list of bounding boxes (an empty list if there are none), each box is a tuple in the form (class, confidence, x, y, w, h, flagged)
    - Class: species of the urchin in the box ("Evechinus chloroticus" or "Centrostephanus rodgersii")
    - Confidence: value between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence that the object in the box is an urchin
    - x: x coordinate of the boxes center point, relative to the images width
    - y: y coordinate of the boxes center point, relative to the image height
    - w: width of the bounding box, relative to the images width
    - h: height of the bounding box, relative to the images height
    - flagged: True or false, whether the box is flagged for review
