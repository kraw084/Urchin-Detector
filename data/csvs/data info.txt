- The complete data set is compiled from the UOA, Tasmania and NSW urchin data sets on squidle
- It only contains the images from those datasets that have urchin bounding boxes/polygons or are empty

- depth: depth the image was taken at
- time: the time the photo was taken 
- boxes: a list of bounding boxes (an empty list if there are none), each box is a tuple in the form (class, confidence, x, y, w, h)
    - Class: species of the urchin in the box ("Evechinus chloroticus" or "Centrostephanus rodgersii")
